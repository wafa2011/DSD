# UDL-SC smart contracts descriptions
 The UDL-SC smart contracts descriptions luangage is an extension of the USDL for service description on the web. the UDL-SC provides a comprehensive and rich description of smart contract that covers functional and non-functional parameters. The UDL-SC covers functional properties such as the interface of the contract. As well aswe enriched it with non-functional properties such as QoS,legal, and security meta-data. These metadata are important to integrate since they minimize the ambiguity and the im-precision of the smart contract.

#Here are the steps to download, replicate, and use our DSD
# 1) Download and extract the ZIP file ( you can use the clone option): 
extract the contents of the ZIP file to your desired location. After that, explore the project.
# 2) Environment preparation and Install dependencies
to prepare and configure your envirnement you can follow this tutorial availble online :https://github.com/wafa2011/TUTO/blob/main/Tutorial.pdf
# 3) Configuring the  polygon L2 side chain, we get test MATIC tokens for the test
# 4) Run the DSD 
to run the DSD, you must deploy its contract on the blockchain networks. So you must follows the second tutorial.
# Testing
To test the publishing descriptions on the DSD, we have prepered for you a set of smart contract description ready to be published availble online .
To test the discovering of smart contract on the DSD, you can use the web interface of the user.
