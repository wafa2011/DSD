# UDL-SC smart contracts descriptions
 The UDL-SC smart contracts descriptions luangage is an extension of the USDL for service description on the web. the UDL-SC provides a comprehensive and rich description of smart contract that covers functional and non-functional parameters. The UDL-SC covers functional properties such as the interface of the contract. As well aswe enriched it with non-functional properties such as QoS,legal, and security meta-data. These metadata are important to integrate since they minimize the ambiguity and the im-precision of the smart contract.
